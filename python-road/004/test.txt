The discussion about overseas study has never stopped in the past few years. Let｀s have a look at its advantages and disadvantages before drawing the final conclusion.
　　The biggest advantage of studying overseas is the higher academic level and advanced research facilities. What¨s more, by understanding a new culture and meeting different people, students can develop a more reasonable and balanced view towards the world. Last but not least, the experience will be invaluable to character building, which makes most students more independent, diligent and enterprising.
　　However, the negative effects are also obvious. To begin with, if a person does not make full preparations before going abroad, he will have great difficulty adapting to the new environment. In the second place, the cultural differences will hinder the regular life in many ways. Finally, money is always a big problem. Many students have to find part-time jobs to earn money to pay tuition and fees.
　　In conclusion, the advantages of overseas study outweigh disadvantages. Once they return home, the overseas students will make great contributions to our motherland.
